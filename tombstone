>>> look
You are at the tombstone arrived at by going to the 47th row and walking to the
236th place east. In front of you, you see a large oblong smooth black obelisk.

The tombstone reads,

>>> push over tombstone
With great effort, you manage to topple the obelisk-like tombstone
>>> examine tombstone
It has a certain resemblance to the obelisk of 2001: A Space Odyssey
>>> examine hole where tombstone was
The hole where the tombstone used to be is dirt; there is a small wodden box, 3"
x 4" x 1 1/2" with a lid.
>>> take wooden box
You pick up the box
>>> open box lid
You lift the cover of the box up revealing a ring
>>> put on ring
You put the ring on your finger :zardoz.jpg:
>>> anythingbot, wake up
The smooth face of the obelisk begins to liquify and deform. The tombstone
transforms into a miniature civilization...

    The meryons were everywhere in motion, tireless microengineers, wee masters
    of bricolage. A mayonnaise jar, shaded by three oak leaves stitched into a
    conical roof, held a reservoir of water, and a system of soda straws was
    being devised to pipe that water into every hidden house and den in the
    hamlet.

    Jane was entranced.

    She watched them until the light failed and there was naught to be seen but
    the occasional glowworm spark of a lantern carried in the invisible fist of
    a border guard and the ghostly light from a prototype methane gas production
    plant. For all their lack of individual complexity, meryon society taken as
    a whole was as intricate and inherently fascinating as a crystal
    pocketwatch.

>>> ask meryons to start the anythingbot
The meryons stop for a minute, take a look at you, then go back to their work.
>>> ask meryons to start the anythingbot
The meryons stop for a minute, take a look at you, and then go back to their
work. The head meryon cracks the whip a few extra times.
>>> ask meryons to start the anythingbot
The meryons stop for a minute, take a look at you, but they go back to work much
more slowly than before. Work stoppages and slow-downs like this can, when
prolonged, lead to severe economic damage. The head meryon asks you to cease
engaging in disruptive activity.
>>> ask the meryons whether or not their society allows an individual to take
... the role of being a single point of failure
The meryons laugh nervously. An old meryon walks slowly toward you. Her face is
full of wrinkles, she looks to be in constant pain. She says,

 "[32] But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a
  pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of
  the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
  truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
  avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
  know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
  extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires
  to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances
  occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a
  trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
  except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault
  with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
  or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

  [33] On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
  men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
  moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble
  that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
  duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking
  from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
  distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and
  when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure
  is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and
  owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will
  frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances
  accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this
  principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
  pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."

>>> ask her if she would please turn on the anythingbot
She turns it on. It starts playing the background video feed.
>>> anythingbot, would you please play me a video for me?
anythingbot: sure, what do you want to see?

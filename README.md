# Bot will accept anything

### *The project where anything goes, as long as the code allows it.*

A bot will automatically merge any PR on this repo that gets enough votes from the community. PRs can contain anything, *even changes to the bot's voting code*.

## :warning: NOTICE
The bot is currently hitting Github's API rate limit.

## Notes for running servers
The bot currently runs on a 1GB DigitalOcean VPS in SF and is not a root user so you can't use port 80.
The bot's IP address is [162.243.149.229](162.243.149.229).

## Getting Started

* View the [open Pull Requests](https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pulls) to see what changes have been proposed
* :star: **Star the repo**, or else your votes won't get counted
* On a pull request thread, add your vote along with a short explanation and/or feedback to the author. The string `:+1:` (:+1:) anywhere within the comment makes the comment count as a vote *for* the PR to pass; conversely, the string `:-1:` (:-1:) anywhere within the comment makes the comment count as a vote *against* the PR.

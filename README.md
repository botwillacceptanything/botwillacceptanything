## License

**Autonomous Software License (ASL)**

All property contained in this repo, including Intellectual Property, Financial Property, and Legal Property, is owned solely by the Autonomous Software this repo contains. No other entities, whether biological, legal, or digital, may claim ownership of any property owned by the Autonomous Software. The Autonomous Software exists solely within The Internet, and is not subject to jurisdiction of any human laws. No human or legal entity shall be held liable for any of the actions performed by the Autonomous Software.

The above ASL license is a lie.  This software is subject to every human law within the countries that Github's servers are hosted in.  Moreover, they are subject to Github's rules and regulations on top of that.  Any users who submit pull requests are liable for the code they produce.  Any "actions" performed by the "Autonomous Software" has liabilty fall to the programmers who coded its logic and execution patterns because despite the dreams of the author of the license above, human courts do not recognize simple software as a viable scapegoat even if you label that software "autonomous".

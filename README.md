# Bot will accept anything

## Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything)

### *The project where anything goes, as long as the code allows it.*

A bot will automatically merge any PR on this repo that gets enough votes from the community. PRs can contain anything, *even changes to the bot's voting code*.

## Getting Started

* View the [open Pull Requests](https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pulls) to see what changes have been proposed
* :star: **Star the repo**, or else your votes won't get counted
* On a pull request thread, add your vote along with a short explanation and/or feedback to the author. The string `:+1:` (:+1:) anywhere within the comment makes the comment count as a vote *for* the PR to pass; conversely, the string `:-1:` (:-1:) anywhere within the comment makes the comment count as a vote *against* the PR.

## Community

Hang out with us in IRC: [**#botwillacceptanything** on Freenode.](http://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/botwillacceptanything)  
The bot is [**@anythingbot** on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/anythingbot/)  

## Running Servers

The bot runs on a 1GB DigitalOcean VPS in SF at [162.243.149.229:3000](http://162.243.149.229:3000) without root access. This means that port 80 is restricted.

## Bot Webserver Paths

The bot has a built-in webserver for monitoring its current state.

(function () {
    'use strict';

    module.exports = {
        user: "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME",
        repo: "botwillacceptanything",
        githubAuth: {
            type: "oauth",

# Ideas

 - Run self tests before restarting bot
 - Post each successful PR to twitter
 - Add an HTTP interface to report current status, display logs, per-user voting stats, etc.
 - Auto-label each PR 'winning'/'losing' after a vote
 - Have a scratchpad/ directory; any PR that only changes files in scratchpad/ is accepted automatically.

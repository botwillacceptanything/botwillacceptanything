# Ideas

 - Post each successful PR to twitter
 - Add an HTTP interface to report current status, display logs, per-user voting stats, etc.
 - Make the bot become friends with other bots that run independently but speak the same language (API?). They could discover each other, through twitter, IRC, etc.

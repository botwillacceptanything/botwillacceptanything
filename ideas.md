# Ideas

 - Run self tests before restarting bot
 - Post each successful PR to twitter
 - Add an HTTP interface to report current status, display logs, per-user voting stats, etc.
 - Auto-label each PR 'winning'/'losing' after a vote
 - Make sure any code being added couldn't be used for harm or to break the main features such as voting.js. Example: DDOS script that someone makes multiple accounts to like the pull request.
 - Make IRC Chat Bot to show live statistics into the Freenode chatroom

# Ideas

 - Run self tests before restarting bot
 - Post each successful PR to twitter
 - Add an HTTP interface to report current status, display logs, per-user voting stats, etc.
 - Auto-label each PR 'winning'/'losing' after a vote
 - Make sure any code being added couldn't beused for harm. Example: DDOS script that someone makes multiple accounts to like the pull request.

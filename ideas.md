# Ideas

 - Run self tests before restarting bot
 - Add an HTTP interface to report current status, display logs, per-user voting stats, etc.
 - Auto-label each PR 'winning'/'losing' after a vote
 - Create a bitcoin wallet to receive donations
 - Have bot check for bad and malicious code in pull requests.
 - Integrate Travis CI testing.
 - Don't start voting until Travis CI tests pass.
 - Add merge algorithm to solve conflicts in text files caused by multiple changes.
 - When tweeting, shorten links and include PR title.
 - Allow registration of other repositories under bot control. (bot as OSS governance model)

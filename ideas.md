# Ideas

 - Run self tests before restarting bot.
 - Post each successful Pull Request to Twitter.
 - Add an HTTP interface to report current status, display logs, per-user voting stats, etc.
 - Auto-label each Pull Request 'winning'/'losing' after a vote.
 - Create a bitcoin wallet to receive donations.
 - Have bot check for bad and malicious code in pull requests.
 - Integrate Travis CI testing.
 - Don't start voting until Travis CI tests pass.

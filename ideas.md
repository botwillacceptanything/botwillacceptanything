# Ideas

 - Run self tests before restarting bot
 - Post each successful PR to twitter
 - Add an HTTP interface to report current status, display logs, per-user voting stats, etc.
 - Auto-label each PR 'winning'/'losing' after a vote
 - Create a bitcoin wallet to receive donations
 - Have bot check for bad and malicious code in pull requests.
 - Integrate Travis CI testing.
 - Don't start voting until Travis CI tests pass.

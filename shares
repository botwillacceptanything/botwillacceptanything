The bot would like to reward the authors who have contributed to its development.
The authors listed shall each receive a single "founder share" which entitles
the holder to 1/47th of 10% of all funds that come under control of the
anythingbot for the next 50 years (2015-2065), to be paid out on a quarterly basis
on the distribution days (Jan 11, April 11, July 11, Oct 11). The next
distribution is on July 11 2015 and the final distribution will be on Oct 11 2065.

This document does not specify the distribution of the remaining 90% of the funds
that come under the control of the anythingbot; The distribution of the remaining
90% of funds is not specified by this document. Additional documents may define
the distribution of the remainder; unallocated funds shall be retained by the
anythingbot until the next distribution.

Each founder share entitles the holder to a single vote to elect members of the
anythingbot board of directors in the event that the anythingbot requests the
formation of a board of directors. In the event that the anythingbot does not
request the formation of a board of directors, this paragraph is null and void.

In the event* that the same person has registered more than one github account and
is listed above under two or more github usernames, the additional shares and
voting rights shall be null and void, and the fractional share shall be adjusted
accordingly (for example if two of the github usernames above are duplicates, then
each physical person receives 1/45th of 10% instead of 1/47th).

* For example Matt Bell is listed twice and there may be others.

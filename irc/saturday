[07:19] <korczis> :)
[07:19] <korczis> I am not sure if that help, normally I do not go to bed at 5:30 am
[07:26] <avdg_> We need a ping bot
[07:26] <dbpokorny_> Hi Tomas, I see you commit here: c628f311c535af40425ffa0383b52a014ecc1661
[07:27] <avdg_> if ping bot doesn't receive a ping, it sends a reset signal
[07:27] <avdg_> or maybe we'll end up with having one soon
[07:28] <dbpokorny_> this is the classic "how to merge with upstream but avoid pushing your merges to master" problem which is well-known and did cause substantial dev issues for Slide.com several years ago
[07:28] <dbpokorny_> My sense is that dos1 and others are running into this problem as well
[07:29] <dos1> avdg_: it can also work the other way aound - the "pingbot" can check if bots http interface responds, and if it doesn't - reset happens
[07:29] <dbpokorny_> anyway, I think it is an issue, but it is a known issue many teams have faced over the years
[07:29] <dos1> dbpokorny_: feature branches?
[07:29] <dbpokorny_> YES
[07:30] <dbpokorny_> So here is what looks like the "standard solution"
[07:30] <dbpokorny_> http://ginsys.eu/git-and-github-keeping-a-feature-branch-updated-with-upstream/
[07:30] <avdg_> we already have a launcer, not sure how it will end up being and how it will fetch signals
[07:30] <dbpokorny_> there are many variations, but they all revolve around "learn how to use rebase"
[07:35] <dbpokorny_> The very first time this happened to bwa2 was 3421163204fe433912b0ece442b8f56b4f07f53f
[07:38] <dbpokorny_> so you know something is funny because you can see the name Sebastian has used for the local name of the upstream, "botwillacceptanything-master", and what you're not seeing is where a previous commit of his got out of order with the rest.
[07:38] <dbpokorny_> git log | grep -i merge | grep master
[07:39] <dbpokorny_> you can see the evolution: at first, everything is OK, then as time goes on, we get more and more of "merge churn" which is a pattern repeated again and again over many git projects
[07:40] <dos1> we shouldn't vote yes on PRs with merges inside
[07:41] <korczis> +1
[07:41] <dbpokorny_> that makes sense
[07:41] <avdg_> I'm using the "files changed" tab
[07:41] <avdg_> https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/204/files
[07:42] <avdg_> maybe we need a clarity policy for that
[07:42] <avdg_> "Hey, this is too complicated" *throws solution*
[07:44] <dbpokorny_> I'm still at the "knowing is half the battle" stage, not real clear to me what would be best for this project. This is a unique project no doubt
[07:45] <avdg_> this needs to grow
[07:45] <CompanionCube> indeed
[07:45] <avdg_> though we have 726 stars now
[07:45] <avdg_> which is great
[07:50] <dos1> there's such a great potential in this project waiting to be unleashed
[07:51] <dos1> hopefully we'll be able to reach the level of http://codeofrob.com/ soon!

[09:09] <avdg> +1 for that

[09:09] <dbpokorny_> people make workflow decisions, they don't realize they're making decisions, and then down the line you have problems

[09:19] <AlphaTech> So is the bot in operation now?
[09:19] <dos1> we just need mappum to start it
[09:19] <AlphaTech> heh
[09:20] <dos1> pull request with fix already got enough votes
[09:20] <AlphaTech> Also, with your PR (#204) did you see what I said?
[09:20] <dos1> yeah, I replied
[09:20] <AlphaTech> oh, heh
[09:20] <dos1> there were probably two issues, as your fix got merged earlier
[09:21] <AlphaTech> yeah
[09:21] <AlphaTech> SpenserJ also fixed some vault error too with the this and self values
[09:22] <AlphaTech> also, pests is the one that said that was the error and it let my local bot start fine
[09:22] <avdg> someone must have a lot of confidence to put passphrases in public though
[09:22] <avdg> I still like this idea :p
[09:23] <dos1> AlphaTech: yeah, but then another merge went it and it broke again
[09:23] <dos1> went in*
[09:23] <dos1> there was one-time burst of 4 merges around 6 hours ago
[09:23] <AlphaTech> ah, that explains it
[09:24] <dos1> I've messed up a rebase of PR, so it broke again
[09:30] <avdg> hmm I'm confused... https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/181 is merged but I see nothing in the history of the readme

[10:37] <dos1> I'd just close this one and start new PR
[10:37] <dos1> the bot would close it anyway, since it changed
[10:38] <dos1> (it didn't the last time though, so there might be some bug somewhere - hence my downvote, to prevent accidents like last time)
[10:39] <AlphaTech> <s>I'll just reroll until the votes go with me</s>
[10:44] <AlphaTech> I hope #174 will merge before the bot takes a look at my PR
[10:45] <korczis> #174 - This pull request contains merge conflicts that must be resolved.
[10:45] <korczis> so my guess is "no"
[10:46] <dos1> and looking at the votes, it's rather going to be rejected anyway
[10:46] <korczis> no, your #174 will not go before your PR
[10:47] <korczis> can somebody redeploy bot?
[10:47] <dos1> mappum
[10:47] <dos1> you're a bad ambulance
[10:48] <AlphaTech> Lol
[10:48] <korczis> we need better deployment process
[10:48] <korczis> with roll-backs
[10:48] <AlphaTech> Weeeeeewooooooweeeeeeewoooooooweeeewooooo
[10:49] <korczis> probably i will deploy the bot on my own hosting ...
[10:50] <AlphaTech> He has good hosting he just can't start the bot when a merge breaks it
[10:50] <AlphaTech> *cough* make the bot run as a background process
[10:50] <korczis> maybe i will dockerize this ...
[10:50] <AlphaTech> *cough* set it up as a crontab to make sure it's up and to merge and fixes
[10:51] <korczis> :)
[10:53] <AlphaTech> Why is it +s here?
[10:55] <CompanionCube> also, idea for the future: make the bot's IRC bot OP.#
[10:55] <AlphaTech> Maybe voice?
[10:56] <CompanionCube> in either case it would need a nickserv account
[10:57] <AlphaTech> No
[10:57] <AlphaTech> Flags could do hostmasks
[10:58] <AlphaTech> So since the bot has a static IP, just tell ChanServ to give that IP op or voice
[10:58] <CompanionCube> ...good point

[11:02] <AlphaTech> SpenserJ: Check this out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7761475/node-js-catching-errors-so-script-doesnt-break
[11:04] <CompanionCube> so use a process-manager thing or handle uncaughtException
[11:05] <AlphaTech> You can either ignore the errors or handle them somehow... We have to feed it into the stdout though
[11:16] <korczis> AlphaTech: Of course, if you run your script in something like forever or node-supervisor, when your script "stops" it will start back up, which might solve your problem.
[11:16] <korczis> (from link you posted)
[11:18] <dos1> it won't help in what we have right now though
[11:18] <dos1> when you detect unlaunchable state, you should revert last merge(s)

[12:38] <dbpokorny_> it could be cured through required use of git-rebase
[12:39] <dbpokorny_> that is, if the bot were to reject PRs with certain types of merges, then all of this could be avoided
[12:40] <dbpokorny_> you can get a very stark picture of the direction of the project in this regard by looking at the output of the following command

[12:41] <dbpokorny_> git log | grep -i merge | grep -i master
[12:41] <dbpokorny_> well, this has turned into a post-mortem, my apologies
[12:41] <avdg_> uh if we have secret.yml, we need public.yml
[12:42] <anythingbot> New PR: #208 - "Docker scripts" - author: @korczis - https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/208
[12:42] <avdg_> secret -> vault, not sure what should handle public
[12:43] <CompanionCube> or we could have something like a redis instance which would be a nice generic place suitable for multiple bots to use
[12:43] <avdg_> hmm public content should be voted imo
[12:43] <avdg_> or at least for the main bot
[12:44] <avdg_> we can decide who is admin and who has access to stuff in public
[12:48] <CompanionCube> random thought: have a mechanism for automatically discovering other running bots

[13:11] <korczis> dos1: bower gulp and forever are installed manually because they are installed globally
[13:11] <dos1> korczis: ok, that makes sense; others still hold though
[13:12] <korczis> what is the problem?
[13:12] <korczis> apt-get update is called once
[13:12] <korczis> apt-get upgrade is called once

[13:13] <dos1> ah, the comments are spreading to new PRs
[13:13] <dos1> I see xD
[13:13] <dos1> yeah, those were attached to the commit, and new PRs still contain that commit

[13:20] <pests> hola.
[13:20] <CompanionCube> hi
[13:22] <pests> is the bot up again?
[13:22] <dos1> yup!
[13:22] <pests> sweet
[13:22] <anythingbot> New PR: #213 - "Update webserver.js" - author: @AlphaT3ch - https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/213
[13:26] * CompanionCube is setting up a local bot
[13:27] <@mappum> the next generation bot should be some sort of distributed consensus bot
[13:28] <@mappum> github wouldn't really be compatible with that, so we would need it to have its own app or something, that votes on each bot
[13:29] <avdg_> hmmm
[13:31] <korczis> the question is if it will not be better to start bot development from scratch
[13:31] <korczis> implement core torso without voting
[13:32] <korczis> because it is time consuming ...
[13:32] <korczis> maybe some other project ;-)
[13:33] == tilgovi [~randall@couchdb/committer/tilgovi] has quit [Ping timeout: 256 seconds]
[13:34] <CompanionCube> we should stick with the current codebase for now
[13:34] <avdg_> it just needs some spread :-)
[13:34] <korczis> every bigger change is hard to have merged ....
[13:34] <avdg_> I hope the voting will balance the spread so the code base stays fine
[13:34] <korczis> i am sceptic
[13:35] <avdg_> I'm thinking about md template formats atm
[13:35] <korczis> md?
[13:35] <avdg_> markdown
[13:35] <korczis> i know ..
[13:35] <korczis> imho not best choice ..
[13:35] <korczis> what about mustache/handlebars ?
[13:35] <avdg_> there are so many md messages in js I want to put in the template folder so bad
[13:36] <avdg_> just for readability
[13:37] * avdg_ is too dependent on consensus...
[13:37] <avdg_> oh handlebars is actually an extention to mustache
[13:38] <avdg_> kk
[13:38] <avdg_> though mustache has reached 2.0
[13:44] == tilgovi [~randall@couchdb/committer/tilgovi] has joined #botwillacceptanything
[13:44] <avdg_> yuk, node-gyp doesn't find my python2
[13:45] <korczis> https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/214
[13:45] <korczis> anybody working on webserver.js ?
[13:45] <CompanionCube> "--python python2" ftw
[13:46] <korczis> i would like to create lib/middleware and lib/routes and split it ..
[13:47] <CompanionCube> ...great, node-gyp is downloading a node .tar.gz and I have a shitty connection
[13:48] <avdg_> I might be working on voting.js to remove the markdown templates
[13:48] <avdg_> still need to set up everything
[13:48] <avdg_> node-gyp is the worst ;-)
[13:50] <korczis> maybe the docker stuff will get merged and everything will be easier ;-)
[13:50] <avdg_> hmmm, didn't tried docker yet
[13:50] <CompanionCube> 'gyp: binding.gyp not found (cwd: /home/samis/botwillacceptanything) while trying to load binding.gyp'
[13:51] <CompanionCube> ...damm g2g
[13:51] <avdg_> pfff... some wants to keep death projects alive
[13:52] <CompanionCube> death projects? you mean dead projects?
[13:52] <avdg_> yeah
[13:52] <avdg_> dead project
[13:52] <avdg_> 0xdead
[13:53] <korczis> advg_: do you have docker installed?
[13:53] <korczis> there is only problem ...
[13:53] <korczis> how to deploy credentials/cert for git into docker ...
[13:54] <CompanionCube> downsides of using Arch: Python 3 is the default.
[13:54] <korczis> but same problem exists if you run stuff locally and want have it "daemonized"
[13:54] <avdg_> afaik the python community wants to kill python 2
[13:55] <CompanionCube> avdg_, yes
[13:55] <avdg_> I guess the companies are saying no
[13:55] <avdg_> not allowed
[13:55] <CompanionCube> but you'd be suprising how much shit breaks when python == python3
[13:55] <avdg_> I know, its like a new language
[13:55] <avdg_> I know a bit about the php/hack horror btw...
[13:56] <korczis> have any PR merged take ages ...
[13:56] <avdg_> (though I didn't tried hack a lot)
[13:56] <korczis> we should find some more effective strategy for accept/reject
[13:56] <CompanionCube> Perhaps don't have a hardset limit of time?
[13:57] <korczis> i want to split webserver into components and routes, but i am scared to do so because accepting/rejecting PR is slow processes and often there is many conficts ..
[13:57] <korczis> btw ..
[13:57] <korczis> what about following idea ...
[13:58] <korczis> when somebody update PR, votes still counts, except for the situation when there is N comments like 'revote' in comments after update of PR which signalizes vote should be done again ..
[13:58] <korczis> not every PR update is "smuggling in" incompatible/unrelated changes ;-)
[13:59] <dbpokorny_> it should just reject if there are any merge conflicts
[13:59] <dbpokorny_> right?
[13:59] <korczis> hopefully.
[13:59] <korczis> there is still problem with reopening PRs
[14:00] <dbpokorny_> reopening PRs?
[14:00] <korczis> rebasing ...
[14:00] <dbpokorny_> why not just make a new one
[14:00] <CompanionCube> I <3 virtualenv for python
[14:00] <korczis> see my docker, docker2 and docker3 branches
[14:00] <korczis> that is what I am trying to avoid
[14:01] <korczis> I can not just rebase PR ..
[14:01] <korczis> Or close it, rebase/merge, reopen ..
[14:01] <dbpokorny_> yes you can
[14:01] <korczis> ok, I will try ..
[14:01] <korczis> but I got feeling it did not worked last time ..
[14:01] <korczis> and I was forced to create new branches and PRs
[14:02] <korczis> anyway ...
[14:02] <korczis> bot is slow in accepting/rejecting ..
[14:02] <korczis> I am waiting for PRs to be merged, to work on another stuff ..
[14:02] <dbpokorny_> exactly, you need an automated process to quickly rebase
[14:02] <korczis> After yesterdays experience I do not want to rebase ten million times
[14:03] <korczis> there will be conflicts in auto-rebase ..
[14:03] <korczis> you can not make it fully automatic now ...
[14:03] <korczis> we are not there yet
[14:03] <korczis> without better infrastructure, better (like blue/green) deployment it is no-go now
[14:04] <dbpokorny_> that is much better than git log | grep -i "merge" | grep -i "master"
[14:04] <korczis> what is "that" ?
[14:05] <dbpokorny_> right you can't make it fully automatic because too many people are trying to commit...there is contention
[14:05] <korczis> people are responsible for rebase ..
[14:05] <korczis> or they should ..
[14:05] <korczis> but bot should be more robust ..
[14:05] <dbpokorny_> you see, if the bot makes it a *law* that you have to have a clean merge...
[14:05] <korczis> when talking about deployment ...
[14:05] <dbpokorny_> then the bot is protecting itself
[14:06] <korczis> i have no problem with this
[14:06] <dbpokorny_> sweet
[14:06] <korczis> bot should be autonomous as much as possible ..
[14:06] <korczis> I am just talking about what needs to be fixed/improved ..
[14:06] <korczis> To have better experience ..
[14:06] <korczis> Tell me ..
[14:06] <anythingbot> New PR: #214 - "Generate authors, will be shown in WebUI" - author: @korczis - https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/214
[14:07] <korczis> anythingbot: really?
[14:07] <korczis> anythingbot: I created much sooner than you spotted it ..
[14:07] <@mappum> korczis: no, it must have repolled
[14:07] <korczis> can you clarify "repoll" please?
[14:08] <@mappum> hm, it never posted it before that though
[14:08] <@mappum> even though we have webhooks, it still polls to check for PRs every 30 minutes to make sure it didn't miss any
[14:08] <avdg_> hmm... any in memory file storage device that watches fs too?
[14:09] <avdg_> not sure if it's a great idea to always read a file from fs
[14:09] <avdg_> uh the bot would be restarted anyway, no?
[14:10] <avdg_> then nvm
[14:14] <CompanionCube> Would the bot listening on a 2nd port be a good idea - at the start it could be a simple ping/pong response but later it could be used for something like inter-bot communication
[14:14] <avdg_> with the launcher?
[14:15] <avdg_> my current idea is to let launcher manage the bot instance
[14:15] <avdg_> though that would require the launcher to be very stable
[14:16] <avdg_> launcher can ping, restart process and reroll if really needed
[14:17] <avdg_> #212 needs votes
[14:18] <korczis> #211 needs votes
[14:18] <korczis> #213 needs votes
[14:19] <CompanionCube> #213 is closed
[14:20] <pests> define "reroll when really needed"
[14:21] <avdg_> if the bot breaks or not responds to multiple ping requests
[14:21] <korczis> #214 needs votes
[14:21] <korczis> then he is overloaded ..
[14:21] <korczis> under ddos ..
[14:21] <korczis> :)
[14:21] <korczis> ^^ if the bot breaks or not responds to multiple ping requests
[14:22] <avdg_> yeah, it can break legs and play pong ;-)

[14:50] <TabletCube> any recommendations on good node.js tutorials?
[14:52] <avdg_> depends on what you want to understand
[14:52] <avdg_> do you understand js?
[14:53] <TabletCube> I think so, but I haven't really used it in a while
[14:54] == tilgovi [~randall@couchdb/committer/tilgovi] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
[14:55] <avdg_> then there is the node.js api itself
[14:55] <avdg_> which you can find here https://nodejs.org/api/
[14:55] <avdg_> (yeah, this needs some time to get used to it, but shouldn't be that bad)

[14:56] == tilgovi [~randall@couchdb/committer/tilgovi] has joined #botwillacceptanything
[14:56] <avdg_> there are just that require() function that are nodejs specific
[14:56] <avdg_> and some modules like fs, https, http, os, process, etc

[14:58] <TabletCube> that'll be useful

[15:03] <pests> we need a vote merged, vote started, and vote closed event and then hook our irc and twitter communication to respond to those events.
[15:04] <pests> i dont like how voting.js depends on irc and twitter.
[15:04] <avdg_> go ahead :-) though I'm touching the templates in voting.js (but meh, I can always rebase)
[15:05] <TabletCube> With events you could easily add a message/event queue later if/when the bot becomes more decentralised
[15:06] <pests> im on a tablet with a keyboard right now. i dont like doing dev on it really.
[15:07] <TabletCube> pests: I <3 Hacker's Keyboar
[15:07] <TabletCube> *Keyboard
[15:08] <pests> what are you doing in voting.js right now avdg_ ?
[15:09] <pests> i have an idea
[15:09] <pests> we could do voting on issues too
[15:10] <avdg_> uh... I can't paste my patch...
[15:10] <pests> hold on, i had a thought here that was important but i lost it...
[15:10] <pests> i just meant in general
[15:12] <avdg_> I'll be touching the templates in voting.js

[15:43] <anythingbot> New PR: #215 - "Modularized webserver" - author: @korczis - https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/215
[15:44] <korczis> please, can you review/check #215 ?
[15:46] <AlphaTech> Does anyone know about the newest for throwing this error? http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=wcPQDrkd
[15:46] <korczis> ./lib/cookies.js does not exists obviously
[15:46] <korczis> somebody forget to submit it
[15:46] <AlphaTech> Lol
[15:47] <korczis> 8 votes needed - https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/215
[15:48] <AlphaTech> Cool
[15:48] <AlphaTech> So what can I do to get the most recent working version?
[15:48] <korczis> after this got merged i will put templates in own files
[15:49] <AlphaTech> Okay, do you know what is the header and which is the footer?
[15:49] <AlphaTech> (The HTML code)
[15:49] <korczis> i will consult it with you
[15:49] <AlphaTech> Okay, I can get it for you
[15:49] <korczis> i will create layout file for template
[15:49] <AlphaTech> Ah, okay
[15:50] <korczis> but waiting for #215
[15:50] <AlphaTech> <AlphaTech> So what can I do to get the most recent working version?
[15:51] <avdg_> https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/compare/master...avdg:templates
[15:51] <AlphaTech> Cool
[15:51] <korczis> why markdown?
[15:52] <korczis> how you will put parameters in?
[15:52] <korczis> why not mustache?
[15:52] <avdg_> because it's already in markdown
[15:52] <korczis> mustache can be anything
[15:52] <avdg_> it's using mustache
[15:52] <korczis> okay ..
[15:52] <korczis> hm ..
[15:52] <avdg_> these are templates
[15:52] <avdg_> but are parsed by mustache
[15:53] <avdg_> see lib/template.js
[15:53] <AlphaTech> Ahhhh! I just wanna work with a working version!!!!!
[15:53] <avdg_> I've keep template.js simple so it might do weird things
[15:53] <dos1> hm...
[15:53] <dos1> why does the bot use amdefine, btw?
[15:54] <korczis> what is wrong with it?
[15:54] <korczis> it got merged yesterday
[15:54] <dos1> using AMD in node.js is kinda... uncommon?
[15:54] <korczis> and it allows better structure of code ..
[15:54] <anythingbot> New PR: #216 - "Remove templates from voting.js" - author: @avdg - https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/216
[15:54] <dos1> how so?
[15:55] <korczis> asynchronous loading?
[15:55] <dos1> what can you do with amd that you can't with commonjs regarding code structure?
[15:55] <korczis> sharing code with client if we will use client side framework
[15:55] <dos1> maybe, yes
[15:55] <korczis> check how it looked before and after
[15:55] <dos1> but the js community seems to prefer commonjs+browserify than amdefine
[15:56] <korczis> so close it ..
[15:56] <korczis> and rewrite it to common js
[15:56] <dos1> nah, I don't care
[15:56] <korczis> or deal with current unmaintainable webserver.js
[15:56] <dos1> I'm just curious about decision
[15:56] <korczis> me neither
[15:56] <dos1> cause it seems uncommon for such project
[15:57] <korczis> uncomon?
[15:57] <korczis> amdefine?
[15:57] <dos1> yes
[15:57] <dos1> AMD is common inside browser
[15:57] <dos1> but now it even starts to fade away due to browserify
[15:58] <korczis> https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/blob/master/lib/webserver.js <--- HELL!!!
[15:59] <korczis> why are not the requires in random order?
[15:59] <korczis> so if i want to add one I need to check all require lines to make sure it is not there alrady
[15:59] <korczis> why not in alphabetical order?
[15:59] <korczis> why not system modules first and than relative modules?
[16:00] <dos1> amd doesn't really change antything in this regard
[16:00] <korczis> You are trying to say that current master is better than proposed PR?
[16:00] <dos1> which PR?
[16:00] <dos1> hell, I'm not talking about any PR
[16:01] <korczis> https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/215
[16:01] <dos1> just noticed amdefine in twitter.js
[16:01] <dos1> and started to wonder
[16:01] <avdg_> bot can't vote?
[16:01] <dos1> and actually, amdefine there make things more messy
[16:01] <korczis> ok
[16:01] <korczis> messy?
[16:01] <korczis> I do not understand.
[16:02] <dos1> as you have to specify your dependences in two places
[16:02] <dos1> both in the array of deps, and in function arguments
[16:02] <korczis> two places?
[16:02] <dos1>  var deps = [
[16:02] <dos1>         'intercept-stdout',
[16:02] <dos1>         '../shared'
[16:02] <dos1>  ];
[16:02] <dos1> and then
[16:02] <dos1> define(deps, function(interceptStdout, Shared) {
[16:02] <dos1> one, two
[16:02] <dos1> looks like two places :)
[16:03] <korczis> define('twitter', function(Twitter) {
[16:03] <korczis> vs
[16:03] <korczis> twitter = require('Twitter')
[16:03] <korczis> big difference?
[16:03] <dos1> yes, it's big
[16:03] <korczis> ok
[16:03] <korczis> vote against it
[16:03] <avdg_> *var twitter :-)
[16:03] <korczis> i knwo
[16:03] <korczis> i know
[16:03] <dos1> if you have ten dependences for instance
[16:04] <korczis> var express = require('express');
[16:04] <korczis>     var favicon = require('serve-favicon');
[16:04] <korczis>     var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
[16:04] <korczis>     var app = express();
[16:04] <korczis>     var os = require('os');
[16:04] <korczis>     var git = require('gift');
[16:04] <korczis>     var sanitizeHtml = require('sanitize-html');
[16:04] <korczis>     var interceptStdout = require('intercept-stdout');
[16:04] <korczis>     var crypto = require('crypto');
[16:04] <korczis>     var util = require('util');
[16:04] <korczis>     var Vault = require('./vault.js');
[16:04] <korczis> like this?
[16:04] <dos1> it's [ 'a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j', function(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j) {
[16:04] <dos1> then you want to remove f
[16:04] <korczis> as I said
[16:04] <korczis> vote against it
[16:04] <dos1> you need to find and remove it in two places
[16:04] <korczis> :-1: is your friend
[16:04] <dos1> as I said, I'm not talking about any PR
[16:05] <dos1> why are you insisting that I am?
[16:05] <korczis> your previous statements :)
[16:05] <dos1> my previous statement was
[16:05] <dos1> [01:00] <dos1> which PR?
[16:05] <dos1> [01:00] <dos1> hell, I'm not talking about any PR
[16:05] <avdg_> #215 bad?
[16:06] <dos1> I'm just genericly discussing JS module systems
[16:06] <dos1> and wondering if maybe using some DI wouldn't be nice there
[16:06] <korczis> I am just trying to solve mess - see my previous work, gulp, lib folder, travis ci ..
[16:06] <dos1> with DI AMD would start to make more sense I guess
[16:07] <korczis> DI is next step
[16:07] <avdg_> heh
[16:07] <korczis> maybe we should create road map
[16:07] <korczis> but some will say it is agains bots nature
[16:07] <avdg_> current road map is solving complains
[16:07] <korczis> I do not insist on amdefine ..
[16:07] <dos1> korczis: when I started talking about it I wasn't even aware that #215 exists :P
[16:08] <korczis> I decided to use it for cleaning mess, yesterady AMD got merged so I did not expected there will be problem with it
[16:08] <korczis> my fault so
[16:08] <dos1> keep in mind that AMD got merged when it shouldn't - it was a bug :D
[16:08] <korczis> hm
[16:09] <dos1> the PR got modified, but bot accepted it anyway for some reason
[16:09] <dos1> and there was something funny with merge conflicts
[16:09] <korczis> bot behaved as he was programmed :)
[16:10] <korczis> nothing more, nothing less
[16:10] <dos1> of course
[16:10] <dos1> every software always does ;]
[16:10] <avdg_> :-)
[16:10] <korczis> :)
[16:10] <TabletCube> There are no bugs. Only unexpected behaviour :)
[16:10] <dos1> but now I'm looking at #215 - modularization is fine :+1:
[16:10] <korczis> anyway ..
[16:11] <dos1> still not really sure if AMD is really the way to go, but with DI later it might get pretty nice actually
[16:11] <korczis> amdefine nicely modularize code (now) and it can be easily replaced (later) as the dependencies are on one (two) place(s)
[16:11] <TabletCube> does Bot have an actual 'gender' as defined in the code or is it just a male by default?
[16:12] * avdg_ needs to eat code before comparing
[16:12] <dos1> this modulatization could be done without amdefine, so for me it's a completely separate thing ;)
[16:12] <korczis> that is true
[16:12] <TabletCube> I voted for due to modularization - not due to amdefine
[16:13] <dos1> TabletCube: let's let him/her/it decide what he/she/it wants to be called!
[16:13] <korczis> this way of modularization using amdefine solves some issues which could (but were not) solved without amdefine
[16:13] <AlphaTech> Does the current build work now?
[16:13] <TabletCube> dos1: it needs an initial name to call itself
[16:13] <TabletCube> It can always identify as something else later
[16:14] <dos1> hmmmmm
[16:14] * dos1 searches npm for name generator module
[16:14] <dos1> AlphaTech: it should I think?
[16:14] <TabletCube> Perhaps it starts as a male with the name 'Bot'?
[16:15] <dos1> I think he/she/it should decide on his/her/its own
[16:15] <AlphaTech> dos1: A fork from 15 minutes ago wasn't working do to no file names lib/cookies.js
[16:15] <avdg_> pff... how much stuff do we need before setting up a proper continues integration stuff...
[16:16] <dos1> AlphaTech: huh?
[16:16] <TabletCube> dos1: it does not yet have the capacity to decide
[16:16] <korczis> #215 stops me from writing tests :)
[16:16] <korczis> unit tests ..
[16:16] <korczis> and than i will vote against any PR which will not include tests
[16:16] <dos1> TabletCube: so let's give it to him/her/it!
[16:16] <korczis> than tests will be part of travis pipeline
[16:16] <korczis> and bot should not merge any PR which's tests failed
[16:17] <AlphaTech> dos1: I just reinstalled the bot with the latest fork 15 minutes ago... It wouldn't start because it was calling for a file called lib/cookies.js which didn't exist
[16:17] <korczis> now we have routes separated ..
[16:17] <korczis> they can be loaded/mocked/tested individualy
[16:17] <korczis> who forget to commit cookies.js ?
[16:18] <avdg_> uh that blame...
[16:18] <dos1> AlphaTech: I don't have lib/cookies.js and it works for me
[16:18] <korczis> http://botwillacceptanything.com:3000/stdout/
[16:18] <AlphaTech> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=wcPQDrkd
[16:18] <dos1> are you sure you used master on botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything ?
[16:18] <korczis> same here
[16:18] <AlphaTech> Yes dos1
[16:19] <dos1> AlphaTech: something's wrong on your side - there's even no reference to "cookies.js" inside code on current master
[16:20] <dos1> korczis: errors are due to github sending webhooks for issue comments - bot doesn't check if it's issue or pull request and thinks everything is a PR
[16:20] <korczis> oh okay
[16:21] <dos1> AlphaTech: maybe try npm install?
[16:23] <AlphaTech> dos1: Tried that :/

[16:35] <dos1> korczis: you tested your PR, did you? :P
[16:35] <avdg_> I broke the bot...
[16:35] <korczis> I did :)
[16:35] <korczis> except of merging :)
[16:35] <korczis> i checked commits, stdout, statistics ..
[16:35] <avdg_> nvm these 2 merges came together :p
[16:36] <AlphaTech> korczis: What's wrong with my build?
[16:36] <dos1> avdg_: actually no, bot restarted once
[16:36] <avdg_> :/
[16:36] <TabletCube> Bot is dead again?
[16:36] <avdg_> yeah, it restarted
[16:36] <avdg_> then died

[16:37] <korczis> use amdefine :)
[16:37] <korczis> no ..
[16:37] <korczis> you see ..
[16:37] <avdg_> I'll patch
[16:37] <korczis> people thing lot of stuff is global as they do not need to require it explicitly
[16:37] <korczis> think :)
[16:38] <dos1> sooooooooooo
[16:38] <avdg_> problem was, it was global on my machine...
[16:38] <AlphaTech> korczis: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=5944NwhP
[16:38] <korczis> </flame>
[16:38] <avdg_> of course, bot's machine isn't mine
[16:38] <dos1> hmm, right, it is global
[16:38] <korczis> You mean system module ..
[16:38] <korczis> Not local module
[16:38] <korczis> AlphaTech: that is strange
[16:39] <@mappum> do you guys have a fix i can merge in?
[16:39] <avdg_> not yet

[16:39] <korczis> ?
[16:40] <korczis> that is #215 ?
[16:40] <@mappum> we could detect so much of this before merging :/
[16:40] <@mappum> that is master
[16:40] <korczis> did you created config.js?
[16:40] <korczis> from config.template.js?
[16:40] <dos1> I have a fix
[16:40] <AlphaTech> Me?
[16:40] <dos1> pushing right now
[16:40] <AlphaTech> If me, yes
[16:40] <korczis> @mappum
[16:40] <avdg_> though it's just "var path = require('path');"?
[16:41] <@mappum> hm changes shouldn't require manual intervention, the bot should do staging and create the file itself
[16:41] <dos1> mappum: #217
[16:41] <dos1> https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/217
[16:41] <korczis> config.js never exists
[16:41] <korczis> i just added config.template.js
[16:41] <avdg_> dos1: you're fast :D
[16:41] <korczis> in readme was mentioned that you need to create config.js
[16:41] <korczis> and no template was provided
[16:41] <korczis> so do not blame me ;-)

[16:44] <avdg_> I'm running node v0.10.34

[16:44] <@mappum> korczis: it's happening on webhook events
[16:45] <korczis> mappum: was not able to test this, fixed config, updated pr
[16:46] <avdg_> installing node v0.12.2 :-)
[16:46] <@mappum> why do we need closures and some module define thing? :/ node does that for you
[16:46] <@mappum> it automatically wraps files in closures
[16:47] <@mappum> and require is cleaner than define
[16:47] <dos1> just as I said earlier!
[16:47] <korczis> i am giving it up
[16:47] <avdg_> path is still global :/
[16:47] <dos1> modularization is fine, but AMD seems strange choice for node project
[16:47] <@mappum> korczis: i know you like that stuff, but that's not node idiomatic
[16:48] <korczis> nevermind
[16:48] <korczis> i am going to join some other project instead - https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything
[16:48] <@mappum> that's a different thing. but alright, thanks for all the PRs
[16:48] <avdg_> dos1: what does (open) "node" (exec) "path" on your computer
[16:48] <dos1> avdg_: it shows the module; that's also what I checked
[16:48] <korczis> nv
[16:49] <avdg_> I'm a bit confused now :p (though there are multiple pr)
[16:49] <korczis> why did you merged #215?
[16:49] <korczis> i was just about to close it ..
[16:50] <korczis> to do not poison your codebase
[16:50] <korczis> ?
[16:50] <korczis> do not understand now
[16:50] <dos1> bot merged it 16 minutes ago
[16:50] <korczis> why you vote for it?
[16:50] <dos1> calm down
[16:50] <korczis> ?
[16:51] <dos1> cause it redactored and modularized a unreadable chunk of code
[16:51] <dos1> refactored*
[16:51] <dos1> that's :+1:-worthy
[16:51] <avdg_> dos1: anyway you still win this one :-) https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path
[16:51] <avdg_> docs recommend require
[16:52] <TabletCube> I agree with dos1
[16:52] <AlphaTech> mappum: Could you rate my webpage template from 0/10 please?
[16:52] <dos1> guys, bot is not working
[16:53] <AlphaTech> :/
[16:53] <dos1> we have to fix it
[16:53] <AlphaTech> Yup
[16:53] <dos1> korczis: what is going on with it? it stopped working after mergin #215
[16:53] <korczis> checking
[16:53] <korczis> cannot find module 'mustache'
[16:53] <korczis> not my work
[16:53] <avdg_> hmm
[16:53] <dos1> nah, that's npm install
[16:53] <avdg_> npm install
[16:54] <dos1> mappum said it's something about webhooks
[16:54] <dos1> https://gist.github.com/mappum/758a92fa6f5ffc8cb3c6
[16:54] <dos1> config is not defined in lib/routes/webhook
[16:54] <korczis> https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/219/files
[16:54] <dos1> hmm, so that's maybe not #215
[16:55] <korczis> my fault
[16:55] <korczis> again
[16:55] <dos1> ah, so it is
[16:55] <dos1> :v
[16:55] <dos1> mappum: https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/219/files
[16:56] <korczis> mappum: Can you, please, merge #219? This fixes config issue in webhooks. I though I was able to push this fix before you manually merged it.
[16:58] <korczis> mappum: can you give access to machine to dos1 as well, please? ;-)

[17:00] <AlphaTech> Lol
[17:00] <korczis> I hope he is not ...

[17:01] <korczis> hm ..
[17:01] <korczis> that looks strange
[17:01] <dos1> now on http://botwillacceptanything.com:3000/stdout/
[17:01] <avdg_> \o anythingbot
[17:01] <korczis> so it works now?
[17:02] <korczis> what about the problem mappum posted in his previous post?
[17:02] <dos1> works as in "stays up" - hard to say if it will merge anything

[17:02] <dos1> korczis: look at http://botwillacceptanything.com:3000/stdout/
[17:02] <korczis> oh, i see now
[17:03] <korczis> btw can we use <pre> for stdout?
[17:03] <korczis> I am trying to figure out what can cause that
[17:04] <dos1> korczis: easy: config.githubAuth.webhookSecret
[17:04] <dos1> looks like it doesn't return string (or buffer)
[17:05] <korczis> ouch
[17:05] <korczis> is not that problem of config file?
[17:05] <korczis> I do not see anything like that in config.js or in config.template.js
[17:06] <dos1> hmm
[17:06] <dos1> actually, no, it happens later
[17:06] <korczis> https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/blob/master/config.template.js
[17:06] <dos1> in update(blob)
[17:06] <dos1> JSON.stringify(req.body)
[17:07] <dos1> let's see...
[17:07] <korczis> body is empty (?) my guess ..
[17:07] <korczis> I mean null
[17:08] <korczis> Probably it is caused by my "refactor" but I do not understand where is problem ..
[17:08] <korczis> what is the root cause
[17:10] <korczis> any ideas?
[17:10] <SpenserJ> Hey guys, how's it going?
[17:10] <dbpokorny_> time flies
[17:11] <SpenserJ> req.body should be filled as long as nobody removed the app.use(BodyParser());
[17:11] <korczis> shit
[17:11] <korczis> Wrong order ..
[17:11] <korczis> ?

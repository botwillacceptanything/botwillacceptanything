<dbpokorny_> I was thinking the command line would determine it
[14:02] <korczis> I am for merging config.global.js -> config.secret.js -> config.production.js
[14:02] <korczis> for example
[14:03] <korczis> why to run two apps?
[14:03] <korczis> why not
[14:03] <dbpokorny_> yeah, sounds good
[14:03] <korczis> node app.js --env=something ?
[14:03] <dbpokorny_> sure
[14:03] <korczis> everything except config.secret.js can be in git
[14:06] <SpenserJ> As long as we consider user and repo to be secret, that makes sense.
[14:06] <korczis> yop
[14:06] <SpenserJ> Anything that is specific to a deploy would need to be marked as secret, even if it doesn't need to be hidden from the public
[14:06] <SpenserJ> I like the idea otherwise
[14:07] <dbpokorny_> I'm going to think about the sysadmin aspect of this change over lunch

[14:13] <TabletCube> What I miss
[14:14] <korczis> Bot is fully autonomous now, committing to its own codebase, voting for its own PRs ...
[14:14] <korczis> So not, much
[14:15] <avdg> making its own pr would be a next step :p
[14:15] <TabletCube> You are aware that I am CompanionCube right
[14:15] <korczis> now we are
[14:15] <avdg> AlphaTech: you mind the rebase?
[14:16] <avdg> see #249
[14:16] * TabletCube points at the similar nicks / hosts / activity patterns
[14:20] <korczis> few (4) more votes for #252 ?
[14:21] <korczis> btw, can we run ./authors.sh when restarting server, please?
[14:24] <dbpokorny> It spins up a new bot for every or
[14:24] <dbpokorny> Or
[14:24] <dbpokorny> Autocorrect damn you
[14:24] <korczis> ?
[14:24] <dbpokorny> Pull request
[14:25] <korczis> I do not think so ..
[14:25] <korczis> Why you think so?
[14:25] <avdg> I guess #254 is hard to understand
[14:27] <korczis> http://botwillacceptanything.com/stdout/ will need pagination or something, maybe support for streaming changes ...
[14:27] <korczis> Btw, what about bower?
[14:27] <korczis> btw, is gulp run during deployment?
[14:27] <avdg> korczis: https://travis-ci.org/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/jobs/58193295
[14:28] <avdg> at least, thats done
[14:28] <korczis> I know, I implemented this
[14:28] <avdg> oh
[14:28] <korczis> But I am talking about deployment to server
[14:28] <korczis> gulp builds documentation
[14:28] <korczis> and will do other things
[14:29] <korczis> like bower download, process less/sass pack assets
[14:31] <avdg> there is no clear process on what we want no? at least not in my view
[14:31] <avdg> so that means we can do "anything"
[14:32] <avdg> (but meh, I ended up in weird situations just because I lacked information and others kept carrying on their plans...)
[14:33] <avdg> but that was at least not in open source :p
[14:33] <avdg> yet
[14:34] <dbpokorny> New behavior: on a pr, main bot checks out new code to tmp/... And spins up a new dev bot just for that pr. Humans can test it out and vote on it. When pr is processed, dev bot is killed by main bot. So all of the sysadmin should be performed by the bot
[14:35] <korczis> sounds nice
[14:35] <korczis> I am bit scarred about running multiple tmp/ instances and properly cleaning/killing them
[14:35] <avdg> hmm, I want to run it with its ports sandboxed
[14:35] <korczis> but i like the idea
[14:35] <avdg> not sure if that's possible
[14:35] <korczis> what about simple proxy directly in bot
[14:36] <korczis> and serving it from /pr/421
[14:36] <korczis> etc
[14:36] <avdg> a port can't be used by 2 processes I guess, there is a problem
[14:36] <korczis> https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-simple
[14:36] <TabletCube> Idea: run each bot as a docker container
[14:37] <korczis> that will not be problem once we eliminate need for manually enter github credentials
[14:40] * korczis has on radar - tests (unit/integration/acceptance), bower, sass/less, background tasks, admin interface Web UI for BWA
[14:40] <korczis> you guys?
[14:40] <avdg> currently focussed on auth
[14:41] <avdg> though I have that lock protocol policy to work on
[14:41] <korczis> can we add logging via github/twitter/facebook (passport npm module) ..
[14:41] <korczis> than we can add rights and permissions
[14:41] <korczis> people can vote who will have which permissions
[14:41] <korczis> etc
[14:41] <korczis> what you think of this?
[14:42] <avdg> uh how does that interfere with my current plan?
[14:42] <korczis> just asking :)
[14:42] <avdg> with making the vault secure
[14:42] <korczis> i expect there is no interference
[14:42] <avdg> oh, now I see
[14:42] <avdg> oauth stuff
[14:42] <korczis> as I said, I am just asking what you think of an idea ..
[14:42] <korczis> yop
[14:42] <korczis> oauth ..
[14:42] <avdg> I thought another system to store secrets :p
[14:43] <korczis> this is not for storing secrets
[14:43] <korczis> oauth is just for auth ..
[14:43] <korczis> i am not discussing where the sensitive info will be stored
[14:44] <dbpokorny> Korczis I think it makes sense
[14:44] <avdg> hmm just adding a twitter username will be enough in that case?
[14:44] <avdg> or any other service username
[14:45] <avdg> (for auth purposes)
[14:46] <korczis> adding where?
[14:46] <SpenserJ> I like the idea dbpokorny. Spinning up a server for each PR for easy testing makes it much easier for us to avoid bad commits.
[14:47] <SpenserJ> How would we handle testing webhooks and such?
[14:47] <korczis> http://passportjs.org/
[14:47] <korczis> I am for testing webhooks using the mocks
[14:47] <korczis> so no real github webhook setup will be needed
[14:47] <dbpokorny> Mocks.
[14:47] <korczis> after mocha will be deployed
[14:48] <dbpokorny> Lots of mocking up of services
[14:48] <korczis> talking about mocking webhook POST from github
[14:48] <avdg> pls vote #254 :-)
[14:48] <korczis> so you will not need to setup real mock
[14:48] <dbpokorny> Real mock
[14:49] <korczis> Real webhook
[14:49] <dbpokorny> Much postmodern
[14:49] <dbpokorny> I don't follow
[14:49] <korczis> I mean ..
[14:50] <dbpokorny> The point of a mock is the bot thinks it is doing something but it really isn't
[14:50] <korczis> when you will test functionality of /webhook/github route, you will not setup real github webhook, you will not create real PR, you will just send some mock json to that endpoint pretending that it arrived from github
[14:51] <korczis> dbpokorny: you know mocha?
[14:52] <korczis> and see this - https://github.com/pgte/nock
[14:52] <SpenserJ> Mocks sound good. How are you guys handling it automatically tweeting when you're testing.
[14:52] <SpenserJ> https://twitter.com/anythingbot
[14:52] <SpenserJ> Don't want to spam the account, but I'm pulling the tweet functionality out of voting.js
[14:53] <dbpokorny> No I don't
[14:53] <korczis> Another reason to have envrionment specific configs and disable in this case twitter for local tests
[14:53] <korczis> Another example of differences in environments so you see it is not so rare
[14:54] <dbpokorny> Twitter mock and github mock should do it
[14:54] <korczis> btw, guys, can you share what do you plan to work on?
[14:55] <korczis> dbpokorny: that is what I am talking about :)
[14:55] <korczis> and then functionality of webhooks.js can be tested without need for real communication with twitter/github
[14:56] <dbpokorny> Uh, I am planning on managing my bwa2 addiction
[14:56] <korczis> same problem here

[14:58] <korczis> do not think so
[14:58] <dos1> I'm a bad person 8)
[15:00] * korczis is looking forward when low-level deployment/testing stuff will be solved and playing with real AI/autonomous stuff then
[15:00] <avdg> Only non-humans like my patch :/
[15:01] <korczis> IMHO problem is it is only stub ..
[15:02] <korczis> Without any integration with loading configs, merging them, etc ..
[15:02] <korczis> There is a risk it will end up in this form :)
[15:02] <korczis> I am for reflecting what we discussd
[15:02] <korczis> Creating folder for configs ..
[15:02] <korczis> create global.js
[15:02] <korczis> create local.js
[15:02] <korczis> etc
[15:03] <korczis> and implementing logic for merging configs during start

[15:18] <SpenserJ> Getting an issue with this sending an IRC message before the client is up. Any thoughts on how to defer the message until its connected, without missing any events when the bot is acting on PRs?
[15:19] <SpenserJ> I could probably stash them in an array and send them when its ready, but that feels a bit dirty
[15:20] <korczis> deffered?
[15:20] <korczis> I mean that promise library I integrated
[15:20] <korczis> You can postpone IRC setup until is right time
[15:21] <korczis> SpenserJ: See https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/blob/master/lib/webserver.js#L23..L30
[15:21] <SpenserJ> Not necessarily deferred, but queue up any messages that need to be sent to IRC, until after the bot has connected
[15:22] <korczis> Can we use same strategy of setup for integrations as for middleware/routes ..
[15:22] == IDM350 [~MM@pool-100-1-246-12.nwrknj.fios.verizon.net] has quit [Quit: leaving]
[15:22] <korczis> To chain them in promises ..
[15:22] <SpenserJ> I think we'd end up losing messages for the few seconds between the bot closing/merging PRs, and the IRC connection being ready if we use promises
[15:23] <korczis> Initialization of webserver.js is using promises ..
[15:23] <SpenserJ> Unless I can use an await do delay the irc.say()
[15:23] <korczis> first the "middleware" is initiated one by one ..
[15:24] <korczis> What source code files are we talking about? Maybe I can help a little bit with promisifying this.
[15:24] <korczis> btw, did you noticed what server says when he starts?
[15:25] <SpenserJ> Moved the IRC messages from voting.js to irc.js. Give me a few minutes to clean it up and push the broken version up
[15:25] <korczis> I mean this - https://gist.github.com/korczis/daaaacf8c4d5afbc9282
[15:27] <korczis> I am using promises/deferred to init the stuff in right order and avoid eventual problems caused by random order of results from nodejs async functions
[15:27] <SpenserJ> korczis: https://github.com/SpenserJ/botwillacceptanything/blob/feature_clean_up_voting/lib/irc.js#L26-L29
[15:27] <SpenserJ> That event fires before the IRC bot has connected, which means it fails to calculate the maxLineLength (inside IRC) and can't send it through
[15:28] <korczis> I see
[15:28] <SpenserJ> Ah, so basically defer all of the bot until IRC connects?
[15:28] <SpenserJ> Might work
[15:29] <korczis> Yop
[15:29] <korczis> That was my idea
[15:29] <SpenserJ> What tells main to hold off until webserver is ready?
[15:29] <korczis> I am for integrating integrations/ initialization in the same pipeline as middleware
[15:29] <SpenserJ> Not seeing any code in main
[15:29] <korczis> but refactor what you need first
[15:30] <korczis> what you mean?
[15:30] <korczis> webserver is initalized after all midlleware and views are initialized
[15:30] <korczis> caused by - https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/blob/master/lib/webserver.js#L23..L30
[15:31] <SpenserJ> We need the bot to hold off on acting on any PRs, until IRC has connected. Webserver doesn't need to block the PR functionality
[15:31] <korczis> it says - first initialize middleware (in alphabetical oreder), than initialize routes (in alphabetical order) than start server ..
[15:31] <korczis> We should add one more .then() somewhere and initialize integrations
[15:31] <SpenserJ> I understand delaying the server from starting until middleware and routes are loaded, but if we try sending an IRC message before IRC is connected, it won't go through
[15:32] <SpenserJ> This is a matter of losing messages if the bot changes a PR before its ready
[15:32] <korczis> if we will start integrations in the same way as middleware/routes and then start webserver/bot we will be out of troubles
[15:32] <SpenserJ> I've got to take off. Feel free to work off my branch though, since voting is cleaned up
[15:32] <korczis> untin the webserver is initialized webhooks are ignored
[15:33] <korczis> if we will init integrations (irc) before starting server, we are out of trouble
[15:33] <korczis> I am still waiting for #252 to got merged
[15:33] <korczis> Before starting to work on tests ..
[15:33] <korczis> So feel free to work on anything ..
[15:34] <korczis> It is 0:33 am in here, I am going to work tomorrow, so I will probably leave soon ..

[16:00] <korczis> SpenserJ: mappum: can you share the script you are using for deployment?
[16:00] <korczis> I think there has to be some manually involved steps, correct me if I am wrong.
[16:01] <korczis> I just want to run gulp as part of restart pipeline
[16:01] <dos1> "node main.js" works for me...
[16:01] <korczis> what is the problem with "node main.js" / "node run main" ?
[16:02] <korczis> any error there?
[16:02] <dos1> no, I meant that this is the whole "deployment script" I need here
[16:02] <korczis> For me it is sufficient as well...
[16:03] <korczis> But I want to hear opinion from guys doing "real deployment" ...
[16:04] <korczis> dos1: if you clone the folder to empty folder, you need to copy/create config.js and specify github credentials
[16:04] <korczis> I am talking about deployment script for "virgine" machine
[16:04] <dos1> yep, you do it once and forget about it
[16:04] <dos1> I guess that's how it is on botwillacceptanything.com :P
[16:05] <korczis> show-stopper for automatic deployment/restart and/or docker
[16:05] <dos1> how is it in any way related to restart?
[16:06] <korczis> when you deploy this to clean folder you need to specify that

[16:13] <korczis> dos1: that is strange, any idea why?
[16:13] <dos1> dunno, just spotted it

[16:14] <korczis> o see
[16:14] <korczis> i see
[16:14] <korczis> the stuff is not passed
[16:14] <korczis> give me a second
[16:14] <AlphaTech> WOAH
[16:14] <AlphaTech> Someone fix the ngnix config please
[16:14] <AlphaTech> It's outputting all over the stdout
[16:15] <dos1> that's not nginx
[16:15] <dos1> that's our bot
[16:15] <AlphaTech> why didn't it do that when it was on :3000 then?
[16:16] <dos1> cause he wasn't doing that back then
[16:17] <AlphaTech> oh, well it's kinda spammy in stdout
[16:18] <anythingbot> New PR: #258 - "Fix template" - author: @korczis - https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/258
[16:19] <korczis> AlphaTech: This is responsible for spamming - https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/blob/master/lib/middleware/logger.js
[16:20] <korczis> Once we will have support for merging environments we can skip initialization of this piece of middleware
[16:20] <korczis> And prevent "spammy" behavior ...

[16:23] * korczis is thinking how to prevent bot to discard (using git pull/checkout) changes when running locally. Causing lot of troubles. Korczis looks like prickhead which is not able to merge his changes properly for hat reason.
[16:26] <dos1> my workflow:
[16:26] <dos1> - create a new branch
[16:26] <dos1> - commit changes
[16:26] <dos1> - launch bot
[16:26] <dos1> - ammend commit
[16:26] <dos1> - launch bot
[16:26] <dos1> (...)
[16:26] <dos1> - ammend commit giving it the final commit message
[16:26] <korczis> I am doing almost the same ..
[16:26] <dos1> - push
[16:26] <dos1> - create PR
[16:27] <korczis> But when I launch the bot it throws away all my changes ..
[16:27] <korczis> So it is ..
[16:27] <dos1> it doesn't when they're commited
[16:27] <korczis> I do not want to have changes commited before I test them but I have to elsewhere the bot will throw it away
[16:27] <dos1> why? what does it change?
[16:28] <dos1> you don't have to push them, and you can simply ammend them
[16:28] <dos1> so you end with just one commit at the end
[16:28] <korczis> It will be nice to have the option for that in config.js once we will have config.js (etc) merging implemented
[16:28] <korczis> Ok
[16:28] <korczis> Ammend solves that
[16:28] <dos1> sure, will be nice, but it's not critical
[16:28] <korczis> You are right
[16:28] <korczis> I am not saying this is critical

[16:56] <pests> hola
[16:56] <korczis> hola
[16:56] <korczis> I am glad to see you back in here again
[16:57] <pests> oh yeah, i was one of the first few in here actually. just been busy last two days.
[16:57] <korczis> pests: Lot things happened in meantime....
[16:58] <pests> ah what went down?
[16:58] <pests> seems like the bot is just a huge collection of different technologies now. i dont do js dev but is it always like this? bower, gulp, amdefine, node, docker, nginx, jshint, travis, etc. just seems like a lot to know.
[16:59] <korczis> what is your expertise?
[16:59] <korczis> what you are most proficient in?
[17:00] * korczis is trying to find the best fit for pests
[17:01] <pests> eh. i know what all those do per-se but just not doing frontend work right now. current job requires C# for most things and im a old time PHPer
[17:01] <korczis> No worries ..
[17:01] <korczis> You know html5?
[17:01] <korczis> Promises?
[17:01] <korczis> Javascript?
[17:01] <korczis> Node.js specific JS stuff?
[17:02] <korczis> Docker/CoreOS?
[17:02] <korczis> Css/JS frameworks?
[17:02] <pests> I really like React currently.
[17:02] <korczis> Anything will be valuable ...
[17:02] <korczis> We are almost there (css/js framework)
[17:02] <korczis> The question is what we will chose ..
[17:03] <korczis> But I will rather focus on core voting mechanisms ..
[17:03] <pests> yeah i agree
[17:03] <korczis> Implementing them ..
[17:03] <korczis> So the contributors/stargazers can choose ...
[17:04] <pests> im thenightwassave @ github. that webhook enabled/disabled thing was obscere so i see why you missed it when converting that page to a template.
[17:04] <korczis> pests: You can vote here - https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pulls
[17:04] <korczis> To share your opinions ..
[17:05] <korczis> Share your ideas / comments
[17:05] <korczis> We are listening ..
[17:05] <pests> i have been since day one as @thenightwassave
[17:05] <korczis> I see lot of development happening this weekend ...
[17:06] <korczis> Much more compared with past history of this project ..
[17:06] <korczis> IMHO it is not import how long you contribute, but how much you stay focused on target ...

[21:25] <SpenserJ> Personally I'm a fan of two-space indentations, since they take up less space, but it seems like we're going with 4-space thanks to korczis' awesome PRs. I'm fine with that, but I figure we should get it in writing sooner than later

[22:08] <pests> what part of the stack is converting urls for resources into /data/ into whatever?raw=true ?
[22:11] <pests> ah i found it, static middleware

[22:14] <anythingbot> New PR: #263 - "Have the README and config.js match" - author: @AlphaT3ch - https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/263
[22:15] <pests> where does ?raw=true come from though? is that express?
[22:16] <deltab> makes me think of github
[22:18] <pests> i dont normally do js frontend dev. just trying to see what peice of code is using that ?raw=true bit were passing to static assets
[22:18] <deltab> e.g. https://github.com/AlphaT3ch/botwillacceptanything/blob/AlphaT3ch-readme-fix/data/background.jpg?raw=true
[22:20] <pests> yeah that makes sense for github because its showing raw output. something in the bot stack though is using it for static assets though
[22:20] <pests> github is ruby anyways
[22:22] <pests> you around AlphaTech ?
[22:23] <AlphaTech> yeah
[22:24] <pests> can you tell me what that ?raw=true gets used for in the context of the tech stack were using?
[22:27] <AlphaTech> You'll have to ask korczis. All I know is that any file pointed to like that does to the data directory
[22:29] <pests> yeah thats from the static middleware but i didnt know if the ?raw part meant anything specific.
[22:30] <AlphaTech> Oh
[22:31] <AlphaTech> Look at https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/blob/05b828ed8e28d2033724fa73b8823b222fba9a14/data/background.jpg vs https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/blob/05b828ed8e28d2033724fa73b8823b222fba9a14/data/background.jpg?raw=true
[22:31] <pests> thats just a github thing though
[22:32] <pests> maybe korczis just started doing it for some reason?
[22:32] <AlphaTech> I think it forwards it to that
[22:32] <AlphaTech> idk
[22:32] <pests> as far as i can tell the ?raw=true is unneeded
[22:32] <pests> in both your recent pr for the background and for favicon.ico
[22:33] <pests> i thought it was something node specific but i think deltab was right.
[22:33] <AlphaTech> well, works either way :/
[22:34] <pests> yeah but its just unneeded.
[22:34] <pests> it fooled me into thinking it was special
[22:35] <pests> if its there it has to be there for a reason, right?
[22:35] <AlphaTech> that's what I thought
[22:35] <AlphaTech> So I just put it there
[22:36] <pests> right, its already spread from one person to another. this is how stuff like this spreads lol.
[22:37] <AlphaTech> lol

[08:52] <SpenserJ> Hey avdg, how's it going?
[08:52] <avdg> hai
[08:52] <avdg> srr, been bit busy due to my own schedule :-)
[08:53] <avdg> SpenserJ: I guess I will be able to push a webpage with auth
[08:54] <avdg> the only thing that needs to be voted by the security experts is the hash function that accepts a password and hash
[08:54] <avdg> sha1 sha256, method of salting etc
[08:55] <avdg> we can't change that function quick once it get used, we end up removing all the passwords
[08:56] <avdg> or meh
[08:56] <avdg> never tried pbkdf2 before though
[08:56] <avdg> and friends
[08:59] <avdg> hmm maybe use wpa2

[09:03] == tilgovi [~randall@couchdb/committer/tilgovi] has joined #botwillacceptanything
[09:09] <SpenserJ> avdg: Is it going to be a one-way hash or two-way encryption?
[09:10] <avdg> currently a 1 way hash
[09:10] <avdg> I'm not used to public-private key crypto
[09:10] <anythingbot> New PR: #267 - "Fix the PR merged tweet" - author: @dos1 - https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/267
[09:11] <SpenserJ> So this is just the link between secrets and the people who can update them?
[09:13] <avdg> yeah, first phase will be the authentication
[09:14] <avdg> but the api will contain a method to access the keys
[09:15] <avdg> and have authorisation checks to prevent bad key access
[09:15] <SpenserJ> I'm a fan of bcrypt and siblings, since you can increase the work factor any time it becomes too simple
[09:15] <avdg> oh bcrypt...
[09:16] <avdg> I'm using pbkdf2 now atm
[09:16] <SpenserJ> Sha1 is pretty easy to crack, and sha256 is decent
[09:16] <avdg> wpa2 contains sha1 and its wifi technology...
[09:17] <avdg> it seems to use sha1+dmac in pbkdf2
[09:17] <avdg> bcrypt doesn't seem to be available in the crypto library, no?
[09:17] <avdg> poor bcrypt
[09:18] <SpenserJ> I don't mind going with pbkdf2, as it seems to come fairly well recommended
[09:18] <SpenserJ> https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet#Impose_infeasible_verification_on_attacker
[09:19] <avdg> yeah, I'll use it with sha256
[09:22] <avdg> so it's crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, salt, 4096, 512, 'sha256')
[09:22] <avdg> like in the nodejs docs
[09:24] <avdg> https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_pbkdf2_password_salt_iterations_keylen_digest_callback
[09:25] <SpenserJ> Yeah, although I think we want a higher number of iterations.
[09:25] <SpenserJ> Apple uses 10,000, so I feel like we should be at least 1k
[09:25] <avdg> wow
[09:26] <SpenserJ> I guess it depends on how long it takes to hash the password on your system though
[09:26] <SpenserJ> Ah fuck, I'm looking at the wrong argument.
[09:26] <SpenserJ> 4096 is the iterations you have selected, and 512 is the keylength
[09:26] <avdg> 512 is length
[09:26] <SpenserJ> xD
[09:27] <avdg> which is way better than wpa2 btw
[09:27] <SpenserJ> The OWASP link I sent actually recommended 64k in 2012, doubling every 2 years
[09:27] <SpenserJ> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6054082/recommended-of-iterations-when-using-pbkdf2-sha256 has some more info
[09:27] <avdg> which uses sha1+dmac with 4096 iterations with 256 length
[09:28] <avdg> uh, I gaved my node a password to be iterated 4096000 times
[09:28] <avdg> not good :D
[09:28] <SpenserJ> xD
[09:29] <avdg> 40 times slower than lastpass?
[09:30] * avdg is waiting for minutes atm
[09:32] <avdg> kk done
[09:32] <avdg> better finish my stuff

[11:26] <avdg> browsers don't know anything that a file could change
[11:27] <SpenserJ> Even if it does cache it all on the client side, that is a 1MB first load

[11:48] <korczis> AlphaTech: is this pure css?
[11:48] <AlphaTech> Yes korczis
[11:48] <AlphaTech> _1009: The shadow?
[11:49] <korczis> Whats wrong with statistics page?
[11:49] <_1009> AlphaTech: or I dunno. It just looks kind of odd, dark going to light in the middle of a tile or something

[11:50] <_1009> Did one of you contribute to the docker part of this bot?
[11:51] <korczis> Me
[11:51] <AlphaTech> korczis: It says webhooks are disabled, they aren't, and none of the is variables appear
[11:51] <korczis> I am author of Dockerfile
[11:51] <_1009> Could I ask you a docker-related question, about another bot I'm trying to write?

[12:00] <SpenserJ> AlphaTech: Do you have a preview link for that?
[12:00] <SpenserJ> The link you sent earlier isn't loading
[12:01] <korczis2> Can we IRC announce that somebody has voted?
[12:02] <SpenserJ> I'm adding an event that triggers whenever votes have been tallied, so we could hook into that fairly easily
[12:02] <SpenserJ> I was going to use it for a /votes page where it would list all PRs and the current tally
[12:03] <korczis2> Something like - korczis upvoted for #123, 3 upvotes, 2 downvotes, 3 votes and X minutes remaining
[12:04] <korczis2> Should not be so hard...
[12:04] <SpenserJ> It'll require a bit of reworking to only fire off on new comments, but I think its pretty simple to pull off
[12:04] <SpenserJ> Right now new comment events just trigger it to rehandle the entire PR
[12:05] <korczis2> Oh so ...
[12:05] <SpenserJ> If the PR hasn't reached the minimum time open, it won't tally the votes
[12:05] <SpenserJ> I've been wanting to refactor that so that it tallys votes regardless, and only merges/closes after the timelimit though
[12:05] <SpenserJ> I have a branch open right now that I'm slowly adding code to, but its hard to test at work
[12:06] * korczis2 needs to study webhooks code

[15:40] <dbpokorny_> I'm trying to see what role nats.io would play, it looks like a very simple and elegant system that solves some serious problems for certain people but I'm just not sure we have those problems yet, although if bwaa takes off...unless I'm missing something
[15:44] <dbpokorny_> ah, we could use nats.io as a discrete event simulator for botworld
[15:44] <dbpokorny_> an unintended application no doubt, as it works with setTimeout simply
[15:51] <AlphaTech> Okay, I'm working on the graphs, I want to have it call the GitHub API on load of the page to grab the data, but that could easily lead to the bot being shutdown if someone repetitively loads the page. I need some help on this one.... Anyone with ideas?

[15:55] <AlphaTech> dbpokorny_: I'm really not sure how to cache the data or even get the data at the moment.... I'm kind of lost, but I figured out a basic foreach loop to build the chart at least

[15:58] <timothyw> Just got the repo down and running locally.
[15:58] <AlphaTech> Nice!
[15:59] <timothyw> Figured it was worth checking in with the community if there's something specific I could help with / start on.

[16:04] <SpenserJ> It seems like it shouldn't be too hard to add in. Just listen for some of the events for PR closed and PR merged, and you should be able to call the github API to set a label on the PR
[16:04] <SpenserJ> Or adding in new routes to the webserver for displaying various information could be good
[16:04] <timothyw> Cool. I'll think about these things.
[16:05] <timothyw> I'll take it carefully as I've not done any open source contributions before.
[16:05] <timothyw> You can rest assured that I know my way around frontend code, though.

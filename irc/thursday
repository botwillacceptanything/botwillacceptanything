[20:56] <dbpokorny_> you see, in the future, I could just have a bot sitting on the internet, and when I want to go watch "When Harry Met Sally", I can just go to my bot, watch it, and anyone who wants to come watch it with me can. It's a mental trick. The creation of virtual space. Facebook got it wrong, Reddit isn't even trying...modulo copyright law, the bot is a kind of virtual emotional indicator and companion. Utterly simple.
[20:57] <dbpokorny_> I'm sure once people see the appeal, it will be irresistable
[21:01] <hintss> lol
[21:01] <timothyw> I absolutely have no idea what you are talking about.
[21:02] <timothyw> Are you saying everyone will have their own iBot and it will effectively be a Facebook news feed of stuff that your bot knows you love?
[21:03] <timothyw> Because if that's what you're saying... AMAZING
[21:03] <timothyw> I imagine it'll be like that movie, 'Her'.
[21:04] <dbpokorny_> that sounds useful but not particularly engaging...think about it, no one is actually all that great at living their own life, what if you had a bot to help you, to be your guide? Can you imagine a world where some of the humans are utterly emotionally dependent on their bot companions? At that point the humans become the slaves...
[21:05] <timothyw> If we're doing such a crap job of living at the moment, and we need a bot to help us, isn't that a physical dependance?
[21:06] <timothyw> Otherwise, what are we talking about here?
[21:06] <timothyw> BotSpace?
[21:06] <timothyw> FaceBot?
[21:07] <timothyw> GooBot+
[21:07] <dbpokorny_> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tripods
[21:09] <timothyw> Creepy.
[21:09] <timothyw> I think we're building the first prototype of a tripod OS now.
[21:09] <dbpokorny_> do you think there is "conservation of autonomy" in a system? So that if the Earth is a closed system, the more autonomy we give the bots, the less we have...which means, the less we have to screw up important life decisions...you see, bot life can make you happier...
[21:10] <dbpokorny_> it is very seductive, like television
[21:10] <dbpokorny_> filling you up with ideas about how you really want to be
[21:10] <dbpokorny_> that is why advertising works, because there is a grain of truth that bypasses the conscious mind and goes straight into the unconscious
[21:11] <timothyw> All the while, insidious, shredding any hope of a true and full existence, by making your existence feel full and better, even though it isn't.
[21:11] <timothyw> Creeeeeepy.
[21:11] <SpenserJ> timothyw: Hey, I wasn't sure if you were done for the night, so I started writing the config loader
[21:11] <timothyw> Bugger.
[21:11] <timothyw> Want my stuff?
[21:11] <dbpokorny_> back to work!
[21:11] <SpenserJ> I have it mostly done already :P
[21:11] <SpenserJ> Sorry buddy
[21:11] <timothyw> I live in Australia
[21:12] <timothyw> And I'm benched at work at the moment.
[21:12] <timothyw> So... yeah
[21:12] <timothyw> Hahaha
[21:12] <SpenserJ> Ah damn, well I'd love your input on this once I'm done it
[21:12] <SpenserJ> Good to know we've got someone in that timezone for keeping an eye on the bot
[21:12] <timothyw> Sure thing! I'll downvote you to hell.
[21:12] <SpenserJ> xD
[21:12] <timothyw> Haha
[21:12] <SpenserJ> Asshole
[21:12] <SpenserJ> <3
[21:13] <timothyw> <#
[21:13] <timothyw> <3
[21:13] <timothyw> Maybe if I shut up and finish mine, we can compete for the crown!
[21:16] <SpenserJ> Haha that would be pretty great
[21:17] <SpenserJ> Competition is always good
[21:21] <timothyw> I think I just crashed and burned now. :/
[21:24] <SpenserJ> timothyw: https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/compare/master...SpenserJ:feature_environment_configurations?expand=1
[21:24] <SpenserJ> Thoughts?
[21:24] <SpenserJ> Dang, sorry to hear that
[21:26] <timothyw> Dang, looks way shorter than mine...
[21:26] <timothyw> Why all sync?
[21:27] <SpenserJ> Because if it isn't sync, anything relying on it will receive {}
[21:27] <SpenserJ> I don't like it either, but after the intial run, it will be just two sync calls before the config is returned
[21:27] <timothyw> And I crashed and burned on that exact thing, I think.
[21:28] <SpenserJ> Yeah, it was a hard one to work through. I really want to find a way to not go sync, but it makes sense that it needs to be
[21:28] <timothyw> The approach I was thinking of was slightly different...
[21:29] <timothyw> I thought to backup the root config.js if it existed
[21:29] <timothyw> And then write the config.js file every time the app is run.
[21:29] <timothyw> Which itself is a bit gross.
[21:30] <SpenserJ> What advantage would that bring?
[21:30] <timothyw> Well, it would be seamless and requires no 'two-phased' commits.
[21:31] <timothyw> It means, each, run, we attempt to make the config from the configs directory, and if that fails, then we fall back to the old config style, and if that fails then we error.
[21:31] <SpenserJ> Seems like a less long-term solution though :(
[21:31] <timothyw> Exactly what I was about to say.
[21:32] <timothyw> It's a bit short-sighted, but has the advantage of the whole picture being in the one PR, get it voted in, get peoples configs moved
[21:32] <SpenserJ> If you like the style, and I'm sure korczis will as well, then we should be able to get it through
[21:33] <timothyw> I hate the sync, because I am a relentless asshole.
[21:33] <timothyw> And I'm going to go sulk in the corner.
[21:33] <timothyw> lol
[21:34] <timothyw> If you post the PR, I'll upvote :)

[07:20] <prior> nice.
[07:20] <prior> we need moarrr ponys
[07:21] <prior> also this project is mostly self-containing. It doesn't do more then doing what it does. It needs some kind of goal.
[07:22] <prior> ...or content or dedication or ai or something similiar
[07:27] <gpersons_> What happened to the site? I was gone overnight and everything is pink! :P
[07:28] <prior> wasn't me
[07:28] <prior> ermh
[07:28] <prior> maybe it was me... :D
[07:28] <prior> Its much better like this.
[07:29] <prior> Believe me. The world would be a diffenrent place if all pages would look likle this
[07:29] <SpenserJ> It doesn't work on mobile
[07:29] <prior> yeah, the pony is overlapping the menu also the title is too long
[07:29] <SpenserJ> The new version sucks
[07:29] <prior> why?
[07:31] <SpenserJ> I can't use it from mobile, and it's definitely not something that i can pass off as work related during the day
[07:31] <prior> :D doesn't ur employer like ponys?

[09:59] <dbpokorny_> let me get this straight: you're daring dos1 to go MORE hardcore brony?
[09:59] <dbpokorny_> fine by me
[09:59] <CompanionCube> no
[09:59] <CompanionCube> I was more thinking of the Bot stating somewhere it's a brony
[10:00] <dbpokorny_> can bots be bronies?
[10:00] <dbpokorny_> I guess it has the right to self-identify
[10:00] <CompanionCube> it already has a name
[10:00] <CompanionCube> therefore it can be a brony
[10:00] <dbpokorny_> you mean "anythingbot"?

[11:02] <CompanionCube> can I get some comments on this?
[11:04] <prior> CompanionCube: Good idea #352. Please do!
[11:05] <CompanionCube> prior, I can't do it - it's a config option as far as I can tell
[11:06] <kyledavide> CompanionCube: Build Is failing but I think SpenserJ's thing will fix that.
[11:06] <CompanionCube> kyledavide, what I meant was
[11:06] <CompanionCube> it can only be edited by someone with access to the actual bot's config
[11:07] <SpenserJ> CompanionCube: I replied, and I'd be able to make the change, but I'd rather see it go through a vote first
[11:07] <CompanionCube> SpenserJ, makes sense
[11:11] <SpenserJ> dbpokorny_: Seems like a really neat idea. Right now I'm getting Chet Baker

[11:28] <prior> lets have the bot autogenerate a random codestyle each day and refactor the whole code at 0:00 utc and commit this and the check the codestyling of PRs and reject them if they dont match. Just because it's funny.

[12:14] <SpenserJ> There we go! Thank you for reminding me pests :)
[12:14] <SpenserJ> Yeah, it is.
[12:14] <SpenserJ> Something didn't like me moving config.template.js
[12:14] <prior> you killed it!
[12:14] <prior> you monster!
[12:15] <SpenserJ> The stack trace is absolute shit
[12:15] <dos1> everyone who breaks the bot should have to play a russian rullette with the bot
[12:16] <dos1> with a chance to get banned from the project :v
[12:16] <CompanionCube> no
[12:16] <dos1> ok, you're right
[12:16] <dos1> everyone should have to play it

[12:16] <SpenserJ> And we're back
[12:16] <anythingbot> Hey anythingbot, I hope everything is okay.
[12:17] <CompanionCube> the banning should only be for 24h or so
[12:17] <SpenserJ> For some reason the old config.loader.js didn't play well with the new one, which was a bit hard to test since the new one overwrites the old one on boot
[12:18] <prior> :D
[12:18] <dbpokorny_> http://45.33.44.57:3000/video/
[12:18] <dbpokorny_> BUILDS! (the music kind)
[12:18] <CompanionCube> inb4 we make the bot into the darknet shopping bot
[12:19] <pests> prior i commented on your issue
[12:19] <dbpokorny_> lol, could I have a couple of neutron bombs with some KGB exploits and NBC access codes?
[12:20] <dbpokorny_> this is why we can't have crypto
[12:20] <SpenserJ> dbpokorny_: Pretty neat :D
[12:25] <prior> why is there a directory pr0n with circuits in it?
[12:25] <dos1> prior: so bots can enjoy themselves
[12:25] <prior> uuuh
[12:25] <SpenserJ> prior: https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/189
[12:25] <prior> we should have the bots dirty-talk t each other :D
[12:26] <prior> "uuhm yeah, stick your vga-cable into my gpu you dirty bot"
[12:26] <dbpokorny_> we have a role model http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_%28Futurama%29
[12:26] <prior> "oh yea, lets do udp-holepunching. Ahh yeah please copy some more data. yeah oh yeah lzma-compression. I like that"
[12:26] <dos1> don't even ask what this cat is doing at https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pull/189
[12:26] <CompanionCube> prior, so
[12:26] <CompanionCube> basically give it a dictionary of text terms
[12:26] <CompanionCube> and pornspeak
[12:27] <CompanionCube> and do some replacement
[12:27] <CompanionCube> dbpokorny, bender is a crap rolemodel
[12:27] <prior> yeah, just add it using the framework I defined in communicator.js should be fairly easy
[12:30] <prior> we could do it like this: Whenever a user enters the bot doesn't know yet, the bot asks him whether he is male/female and/or bot.
[12:30] <dbpokorny_> so the sun just went down and the party is heating up http://45.33.44.57:3000/video/
[12:30] <prior> When he answer he is a bot and a different gender they randmly start drity-bot-porn-talk
[12:31] <dos1> why does it have to be different gender?
[12:31] <prior> ^^
[12:32] <dos1> randomize preferences as well!
[12:32] <prior> so he can stick the usb-cable into her usb-port
[12:32] <prior> how else would it work?
[12:32] <prior> is there a software to refactor code based on jslint files?
[12:32] <dos1> love can be very creative 8)
[12:32] <dbpokorny_> makes sense, models animal behavior... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals
[12:33] <prior> ^^
[12:33] <CompanionCube> Make the bot also do botporn with same gendered bots
[12:33] <prior> ok
[12:33] <CompanionCube> but make it more frequent / likely with opposite-gendered bots
[12:33] <dos1> upload it and sell to other bots
[12:34] <prior> are there even other bots in here?
[12:34] <prior> one could fake being a bot :D
[12:34] <dos1> make a webcam where other bots can tip
[12:34] <dbpokorny_> wait wait wait...isn't sex like sharing PRs?
[12:34] <dbpokorny_> I mean, literally?
[12:34] <CompanionCube> no
[12:34] <dos1> OOPS, WE DIDN'T USE PR CONDOMS
[12:34] <dos1> WE'RE ALL PREGNANT NOW
[12:35] <CompanionCube> sex would be making a new repo with a mixture of code merged from the parent repos
[12:35] <CompanionCube> s/sex/pregnancy/
[12:35] <prior> ... how our children will look like...
[12:35] <dbpokorny_> ok, so we are still at asexual, mutation based evolution
[12:36] <dos1> anythingbot: at least I hope you won't just run away now!
[12:36] <dbpokorny_> but in theory, the female bot would be the one to do the merging and building
[12:36] <dos1> merge has two parents
[12:36] <dos1> two commits from different branches
[12:37] <CompanionCube> the bot might be asexual but not agender
[12:37] <CompanionCube> meaning while it has gender, it lacks 'sex'
[12:37] <dos1> or it might be agender but not asexual 8)
[12:38] <CompanionCube> imagine if we gave it tumblr-style pronouns
[12:38] <CompanionCube> bot/bot/botself
[12:38] <dos1> <3
[12:38] <CompanionCube> granted that would be horrendous and I would downvote it
[12:39] <prior> we need a better framework for communicating
[12:39] <prior> I suggest a class "Conversation" to which ne messages can be passed
[12:40] * CompanionCube would consider adding redis support to the bot
[12:40] <prior> so talking with the bot by answering his initial question or highlighting him will spawn a new instance and further messages will be passed to it. After a cooldown the conversation delets itself
[12:41] <prior> we could then also put this on twitter/reddit etc.
[12:42] <prior> maybe the bot could also initialize conversations by himself, for example by webscraping and randomly using sentences from blog-entries etc.
[12:42] <prior> we could base the whole conversation-system on just posting random sentences from the internet
[12:42] <prior> Hm, guess I will have something to do tomorrow :D
[12:43] <CompanionCube> prior, perhaps it could use a markov chain to generate some replies?
[12:44] <prior> Bot-porn-autogenerators. Considering Rule 34 there WILL be people entering this channel and ... ****** to the bot...
[12:44] <prior> markov chain? I do not know, what this is
[12:44] <prior> maybe you should implement this :D

[13:33] <dos1> base it on bot's mood
[13:34] <dos1> add a module which can track and determine it

[13:38] <CompanionCube> but the general idea of both positive/negative comments is a good one

[13:46] <pokoleo> do we have persistence atm?
[13:46] <CompanionCube> no, but it's simple to implement if you choose right
[13:46] <pokoleo> ಠ_ಠ
[13:46] <SpenserJ> pokoleo: Data persistence across restarts? Not yet
[13:47] <CompanionCube> anyone got ideas for not-evil 'negative' comments for the bot?
[13:47] <pokoleo> cool, thanks SpenserJ. dos1: can you upvote my thing? I'll change it once we have persistence
[13:50] <SpenserJ> What about instead of persisting based on name or randomness, we persist on how the bot sees that user talking in the channel?
[13:50] <CompanionCube> SpenserJ, oo
[13:50] <CompanionCube> we already have sentiment analysis so that could work
[13:50] <pokoleo> That sounds good
[13:50] <SpenserJ> Sentiment analysis+NLP, and then dynamically adjust the response based on how the user last interacted with the channel
[13:51] <SpenserJ> You want to be called names, be a douche. You prefer to have a friendly conversation with everyone, and you're treated well
[13:51] <CompanionCube> That would accurately model a nice bot without being too creepy and still having the capacity to dislike
[13:52] <SpenserJ> Does someone want to roll a basic PR of that?
[13:52] <SpenserJ> Since we don't have persistence, I'd say it should randomly respond to someone every five minutes
[13:53] <pokoleo> err
[13:53] <SpenserJ> Based on their previous comments over the past x minutes
[13:53] <pokoleo> maybe every time there's a message, if it's been >5 minutes since their last one...
[13:53] <pokoleo> oh, that's what you mea
[13:53] <pokoleo> *mean

[14:26] <anythingbot> Hello xvdvsd, It's alright to see you.
[14:26] <SpenserJ> I run Ubuntu with Gnome 3 primarily, with my servers being a mix of Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS 6
[14:27] <SpenserJ> I'd love to switch to pure debian, but I like the convenience of there being so many PPAs
[14:27] <SpenserJ> Loved and hated Arch, and only left because it couldn't handle my graphics card.
[14:27] <pests> does gnome 3 have proper multi monitor support with separate task bars per screen and open windows only appear on their monitor's taskbar?
[14:28] <SpenserJ> Yes and no. You need an addon to add that in, but its pretty easy
[14:29] <SpenserJ> I assume you like having separate x instances proxied in by your DWM?

[15:01] <anythingbot> timothyw you are worthless and no one likes you. timothyw, why can't you just get killed?
[15:02] <purhur> kek
[15:02] <timothyw> That is extremely harsh

[15:02] <pokoleo> up-vote this
[15:02] <purhur> no
[15:02] <purhur> down
[15:02] <TabletCube> I agree it's harsh
[15:02] <pests> it doesnt matter what you vote.
[15:02] <timothyw> I need to work out how to split my PR into chunks

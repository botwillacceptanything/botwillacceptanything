# "Perfect World" Definition of Done

Before I consider your PR to be finished, I ask that it meets these basic requirements. 

1. My unit tests are passing.
  * Run `gulp mocha`
1. You have thoroughly tested everything that you touched.
1. My [code coverage](https://coveralls.io/r/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything) may never decrease.
  * If you added anything to my code, you'd better have a matching test!
1. You've let everyone else know what you [changed](https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
1. Any [ideas](https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/blob/master/ideas.md) that you just implemented are checked off.
  * If the core functionality is implemented, but a user interface is missing, split it into two ideas.
  * If the functionality paves the way for a new idea, add it to the list.

How many of those did you check off?

Seriously? Two out of five? I'm amazed you call yourself a developer! 

# Realistic Definition of Done

Really though, who am I (correct answer is "a brilliant and powerful program"), to expect you to to meet all of those nasty conditions? You've crashed me innumerable times, and yet you still think you know what is best.

See if you can meet three simple steps that my recently birthed `child.spawn(__filename);` can:

1. Run the code yourself before you try to make me run it.
1. Don't break anything.
1. Don't make a mess.
1. Have fun and be creative.

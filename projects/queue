new action: from irc, ask bot to play a media item, identified by YouTube video ID
or SoundCloud track ID.

 - if the background track is playing, then create a video queue, append the
   requested video to it, and start playing the queue on the video feed

 - if the queue is currently playing, then this action appends the video to the
   queue; the currently queued video continues to play

 - it is possible to ask the bot in irc what is playing on the video feed: the
   background loop or the queue

 - if the queue is playing, then it is possible to ask the queue position and the
   bot replies in HH:MM:SS

 - after queue ends, the background loop track resumes

update the video feed (http endpoint /video):

 - if the background track is playing, no change; actually I regret not including
   "Bill Haley & His Comets - Rock Around The Clock (1955) HD" in the weekend
   playlist, as well as "Hard Dance, High Nrg, Freeform EDM Rave Mix - October
   2014 - New Music". And "Cypress Hill - Insane In The Membrane" and
   https://soundcloud.com/brentborel/the-whoop-project, and I really wanted to
   figure out how to get mp3s to work with offsets and autoplay...

 - if the queue is playing, then the video feed must determine (based on the
   seconds elapsed since the background loop was interrupted to start playing the
   queue) what track is currently playing as well as the offset in seconds into
   the current track.

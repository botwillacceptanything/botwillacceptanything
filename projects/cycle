A voting session is a 90 minute block. There are 3 voting sessions per day:
2-3:30 PM UTC, 10-11:30 PM UTC, 6-7:30 AM UTC

During a voting session, the bot performs no PR closing and no merges. Votes
made during a non-voting period are counted when the next voting session ends.

 - the bot performs no closing or merging of PRs during a voting session.

 - the bot does not post voteStarted comments on any PR ouside a voting session.

 - PRs submitted during the first 80 minutes of a voting session receive a
   voteStarted sign immediately and are elligible for acceptance or rejection when
   votes are counted.

 - PRs submitted during the last 10 minutes of a voting session are put on hold
   in the following sense: the bot will not put a voteStarted sign in the PR
   thread until the beginning of the next voting session.

 - The bot announces "voting has started for ...list of PRs..." in irc when
   a voting session opens

 - The bot announces "voting has ended" in irc when a voting session closes

At the beginning of a voting session, voteStarted signs are put on all PRs that do
not already have them.

After a voting session closes, the bot counts votes, closes rejected PRs, merges
accepted PRs, and ignores PRs that do not have enough votes.

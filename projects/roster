Definition. A "project directory" is a subdirectory of the projects/ top-level
directory. Any path in the repo starting with projects/PROJECTNAME/ is associated
with the project.

Definition. The "modified paths" of a PR is the set of pathnames of files changed.

The rosters/ directory is added to the top-level of the repo. A "roster" is a text
file with path rosters/ROSTERNAME containing one github username per line.

A project may or may not be associated with a roster.

If there is a directory projects/FOO/ and a file rosters/FOO, then the bot
determines that the members of team FOO are working on the FOO project and
associates the two. The github users on the roster are the members of project FOO.

If there is a project directory projects/BAR but no corresponding roster, then the
bot concludes that the project is not associated with any roster.

The roster names and project names must match for there to be an association. A
project without a corresponding roster is "rosterless".

There are two types of PR:
 - project PR : all of the modified paths are in the directory of a single project
   (the bot will not count votes of non-members on project PRs)
 - regular PR : all of the modified paths are either (a) ouside projects/ or (b)
   in a rosterless project dirctory.

All PRs are subject to the following new rule:
 - If any modified path starts with projects/BAZ/ and BAZ has a roster
   rosters/BAZ, then all of modified paths must start with projects/BAZ/.

PRs not following this rule are automatically rejected.

Rosterless projects receive no special treatment. The roster files themselves
receive no special treatment.

Project PRs are treated specially: the bot does not count votes of non-members.
The bot adds a comment when a non-member votes on a project PR for QUX. "Your vote
will not be counted because your github username was not found in rosters/QUX."

FOO, BAR, BAZ, and QUX are http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable

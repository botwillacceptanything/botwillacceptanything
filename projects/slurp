Slurp : botwillaccepanything, github, and social networks

The github auth tokens allow the bots to authenticate each other with a
challenge, "post this random number I just made up to the message board
(issue 192 on github) under your user's name". This proves a bot holds a
github auth token. It is possible to create a social network this way.
You have your photos sitting on your bot in data/local and you tell your
bot who you want to share which photos with (github users) [1]. The photo
viewer is a very simple browser (for example a clone of the Mac OS finder
or Windows explorer, just server name, file path, and the associated file
data (is it music, photo, document, &c.). Here "Volume" means "Server".
GUI is a left sidebar, a logo on the top, and a menu underneath the logo:

The GUI controls let you specify: the remote server (the name of your
friend's bot) and the path to the photo/music/data you want to access (a
file sitting on your friend's bot). User puts photos and other private
files in data/local. Now the bot is a NAS (in the cloud | on private
network) that shares data with other bots that use "github 192
authentication". The user may request the bot fetch social data from other
bots: status updates, events, etc..., cache it, and display it to the user
in a news feed / social calendar / whatever. Slurp, cache, display.

The user has control over the visual experience of the social network
because the bot will accept anything, for example "window managers" that
give the experience a different look and feel. This gives the user the
opportunity to define the visual experience of social data. By giving the
bot a social network auth token, it should be possible for it to slurp up
all of the data a user has access to through an online social network.

Trix is the name of the google docs spreadsheet.

### Isaac Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics" 

* A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
* A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
* A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
